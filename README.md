## üìÇ Project Structure

This project follows a standard Go application layout, leveraging the Cobra framework for command-line interface management. The codebase is structured to separate CLI concerns from core business logic, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using the tool, configure your YouTrack URL and API Token:

### Initial Configuration

```bash
youtrack-cli configure
```

1. **Enter your YouTrack URL**  
   - Use the base URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.youtrack.cloud` or `https://youtrack.example.com`)  
   - Do **not** include `/api` or any path.

2. **Enter your API Token**  
   - Log in to YouTrack.  
   - Go to: `Profile > Account Security` (or `Hub > Authentication`)  
   - Click `New token`, name it (e.g., `youtrack-cli`), and select `YouTrack` scope.  
   - Copy the token (starts with `perm:`) and paste it in the prompt.

### View Configuration

Display your current YouTrack configuration. The API Token will be partially masked for security.

```bash
youtrack-cli config show
```

### Set Configuration Values

Set specific configuration values like your default board or sprint.

```bash
youtrack-cli config set [key] [value]
```

Examples:

```bash
youtrack-cli config set board "My Agile Board"
youtrack-cli config set sprint "Sprint 26"
```

### List Agile Boards

List all available Agile Boards in your YouTrack instance. This is useful for finding the exact board name to set as your default.

```bash
youtrack-cli config list-boards
```

### List Sprints for a Board

List all sprints for a specified board. If no board is specified, it uses the configured default board.

```bash
youtrack-cli sprint list --board "My Agile Board"
# Or, if a default board is configured:
youtrack-cli sprint list
```

---

## üß∞ Usage

### List Issues

```bash
# List your assigned issues
youtrack-cli list

# List issues for a specific sprint (wrap sprint name in quotes if it contains spaces)
youtrack-cli list -s "Sprint 26"

# Output in JSON (for Neovim integration)
youtrack-cli list --json
```

### Add Work Item

```bash
youtrack-cli add-work [issue-id] [minutes] [description]
```

Example:

```bash
youtrack-cli add-work DP-123 60 "Fixed a bug"
```

### Check Work

```bash
# Find issues assigned to you without work logged today
youtrack-cli check-work
```

---

## üß† Neovim/LazyVim Integration

1. Copy integration script:

```bash
cp neovim-integration.lua ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/
```

2. Sync LazyVim:

```vim
:Lazy sync
```

3. Use shortcuts:

- `<leader>yl`: List YouTrack issues
- `<leader>ya`: Add work item
- `<leader>yc`: Show YouTrack configuration
- `<leader>yb`: List YouTrack boards
- `:TelescopeYoutrack`: Display issues in Telescope (if configured)

4. **(Optional)** Enable reminders:  
   If using `nvim-notify`, it will show alerts when `youtrack-cli check-work` detects missing work logs.

---

## üõ† Development

- Source: Edit `main.go`  
- Dependencies: Managed via `go.mod`  
- Build:

```bash
go build -o youtrack-cli
```

- Git setup (SSH):

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:dukechill/youtrack-cli.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üß™ Troubleshooting

### API Connectivity and Query Issues

If `youtrack-cli` commands are not returning expected results, especially for `list` or `sprint list`, it might be due to incorrect configuration, API token issues, or incorrect board/sprint names.

1.  **Verify Configuration**: Use `youtrack-cli config show` to ensure your YouTrack URL, API Token, and configured board/sprint names are correct.

2.  **Test API Connectivity with `curl`**:  
    You can directly test the YouTrack API using `curl` to confirm connectivity and token validity. Replace `YOUR_YOUTRACK_URL` and `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual values.

    *   **List your assigned issues:**
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" "YOUR_YOUTRACK_URL/api/issues?query=for:me&fields=idReadable,summary"
        ```

    *   **List issues in a specific board and sprint (e.g., "CRM‰øÉÊ°àÁÆ°ÁêÜ" and "Sprint 26"):**
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" "YOUR_YOUTRACK_URL/api/issues?query=Board%20%22CRM%E4%BF%83%E6%A1%88%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%22%3A%20%7B%22Sprint%2026%22%7D&fields=idReadable,summary"
        ```
        *Note: The board and sprint names are URL-encoded. `CRM‰øÉÊ°àÁÆ°ÁêÜ` becomes `%22CRM%E4%BF%83%E6%A1%88%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%22` and `Sprint 26` becomes `%22Sprint%2026%22`.*

    *   **List Agile Boards:**
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" "YOUR_YOUTRACK_URL/api/agiles?fields=id,name"
        ```

    *   **List Sprints for a specific Board (e.g., Board ID `121-114` for "CRM‰øÉÊ°àÁÆ°ÁêÜ"):**
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" "YOUR_YOUTRACK_URL/api/agiles/121-114/sprints?fields=id,name"
        ```
        *You can find the Board ID using the `list-boards` command or the `curl` command above.*

3.  **Check Board and Sprint Names in YouTrack**:  
    Ensure the board and sprint names you are using in `youtrack-cli` commands exactly match those in your YouTrack instance.  
    *   **For Board Names**: Navigate to `Agile Boards` in YouTrack and verify the exact spelling and casing.  
    *   **For Sprint Names**: Go to your specific Agile Board, and check the names of the sprints. Pay close attention to spaces or special characters.

### Neovim Integration Issues

- Confirm `telescope.nvim` and `nvim-notify` are installed:

```vim
:Lazy list
```

- Verify command paths in `neovim-integration.lua`
